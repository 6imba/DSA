Dictionary in Python is hash map behind the scene
--------------------------------------------

- Kind of problem need to be solve + select proper data structure.
- memory(RAM) layout: position/structure of data
- List: serial data allocation in memory(contigeous memory location)
- Dictionary in Python is hash-map behind the scene: key->hash-function->address-of-bucket,(Order of 1-complexcity for search-fast)

- Programming is art(well knowledeg of DSA) and science

- Data structure: Array, Hash-Table, Linked-List.
- Programming Language:
     - Python: List, Dictionary, Not avialable
     - Java: Native array/ArrayList, HashMap/ LinkedHashMap, Linkedlist
     - C++: Native array/ std::vector, std::map, std::list

- Big O notation.
	- Big-O-notation is used-to-measure how running-time or space-requirements for-your-program grow as input-size growns.
