5,6,9,1,4,3

min = 5
comparing 5 with 6 where 6 is greter than 5 so  the minimum remains same
5,6,9,1,4,3
comparing 5 with 9 where 9 is greater than 5  so the minimum remains same
5,6,9,1,4,3
comparing 5 with 1 where 1 is smaller than 5 so the miniumum is set to 1
min = 1
comparing 1 with 4 where 4 is greater than 1 so the miniumum remains same
5,6,9,1,4,3
comparing 1 with 3 where 3 is greater than 1 so the minimum remains same

Now,
exchanging the first element with the minumum, so
1,6,9,5,4,3
Now minimum is set to 6 as its is unsorted
min = 6
comparing 6 with 9 where 9 is greater than 6 so the minimum remains same
1,6,9,5,4,3
comparing 6 with 5 where 5 is smaller than 6 so the minimum is set to 5
min = 5
1,6,9,5,4,3
comparing 5 with 4 where 4 is smaller than 5 so the minimum is set to 4
min = 4
1,6,9,5,4,3
comparing 4 with 3 where 3 is smaller than 4 so the minimum is set to 3
min = 3
1,6,9,5,4,3

Exchaning the unsorted element with the minimum
1,3,9,5,4,6

min = 9 
1,3,9,5,4,6
comparing 9 with 5 where 5 is smaller than 9 so the minimum is set to 5
min = 5
1,3,9,5,4,6
comparing 5 with 4 where 4 is smaller than 5 so the minimum is set to 4
min = 4
1,3,9,5,4,6
comparing 4 with 6 where 6 is greater than 4 so the minimum remains same
min = 4
1,3,9,5,4,6

Exchanging the unsorted element with the minimum
1,3,4,5,9,6

comparing 5 with 9 where 5 is smaller than 9 so the minimum remains unchanged
min = 5
1,3,4,5,9,6
comparing 5 with 6 where 5 is smaller than 6 so the minimum remains unchanged
min = 5
1,3,4,5,9,6

min = 9
1,3,4,5,9,6
comparing 9 with 6 where  6 is smaller than 9  so the minimum is set to 6
min = 6
1,3,4,5,9,6

Exchanging the unsorted wlement with the minimum
1,3,4,5,6,9
